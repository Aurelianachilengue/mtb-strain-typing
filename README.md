# mtb-strain-typing

Tools and workflows for reference-free genomic analysis of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strain typing.  
This repository contains R scripts and helper workflows for evaluating reference-free genetic distance methods (PopPUNK, Mash, SKA2, DNAdiff) and generating visualisations and phylogenetic trees for downstream strain-typing analysis.

## Overview

This project provides scripts to:

- Build **hierarchical clustering trees** (Newick format) using distance matrices generated by distance methods (DNAdiff, PopPUNK, Mash, SKA2)  
- Produce **membership ratio plots** to summarise performance across lineage, sublineage, and deeper phylogenetic levels  
- Generate histograms showing within- and between-lineage genetic distance distributions  

The repository is designed to be lightweight and focused solely on analysis scripts.  
Distance matrices must be generated externally using PopPUNK, Mash, SKA2, or DNAdiff, as described in their original publications.
