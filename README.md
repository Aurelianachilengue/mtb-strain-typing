# mtb-strain-typing

Tools and workflows for reference-free genomic analysis of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strain typing.  
This repository contains R scripts and helper workflows for evaluating reference-free genetic distance methods (PopPUNK, Mash, SKA2, DNAdiff) and generating visualisations and phylogenetic trees for downstream strain-typing analysis.

## Overview

This project provides scripts to:

- Build **hierarchical clustering trees** (Newick format) using distance matrices generated by distance methods (DNAdiff, PopPUNK, Mash, SKA2)  
- Produce **membership ratio plots** to summarise performance across lineage, sublineage, and deeper phylogenetic levels  
- Generate histograms showing within- and between-lineage genetic distance distributions  

The repository is designed to be lightweight and focused solely on analysis scripts.  
Distance matrices must be generated externally using PopPUNK, Mash, SKA2, or DNAdiff, as described in their original publications.

## Input Requirements

Distance matrices must be generated externally using the original tools:

PopPUNK

Mash

SKA2

DNAdiff / dnadiff (from MUMmer)

This repository does not run these tools; it only processes their outputs.

## Recommended Use

Clone the repository and run the R scripts within analysis/ to reproduce:

clustering trees

membership ratio plots

genetic distance distribution figures

supplementary visualisations for publications
